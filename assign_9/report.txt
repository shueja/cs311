Summary of the Project:
Development of prog9, capable of determining with the main functionality of 
determining the shortest route between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
The program reads city and road data from text files, constructs a graph, and 
then computes and displays the path and distance between any two given cities.

Problem Resolution:
The program successfully solves the intended problem using a graph. It 
calculates the shortest distance between two cities, along with the path 
taken, using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Program Functionalities:
-Reads and processes city and road data from files, creating a corresponding graph.
-Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between two cities.
-Accepts city codes as command-line arguments
