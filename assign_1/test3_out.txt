Test 3: ------- Copy Constructor and assignment operator = -------
Step 1: Create a 5 element list L1 = [1,2,3,4,5] 
L1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 2: pass L1  to a client function called CopyTest to test your copy constructor
In copy test function, an element 6 is added to the copied list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
After copytest, the original shouldn't change 
Step 3: Display L1 (this should still be a 5 element list)
L1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 4:  Assigning a list to itself shouldn't change it
L1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 5: Create a 4 element list L2 with 7,8,9,10.
L2: [7, 8, 9, 10]
Step 6:  L2 = L1, (L2 becomes 5 elements 1,2,3,4,5)
L2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Step 7: Remove a rear node from L1. (This should not affect L2)
L1 :[1, 2, 3, 4]
L2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
